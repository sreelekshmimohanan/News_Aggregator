That officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His bail was set at $1.25 million in a court appearance on Monday. The outpouring of anger and outrage after Mr. Floyd’s death — and the speed at which protests spread from tense, chaotic demonstrations in the city where he died to an international movement from Rome to Rio de Janeiro — has reflected the depth of frustration borne of years of watching black people die at the hands of the police or vigilantes while calls for change went unmet."""
